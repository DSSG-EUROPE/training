There ain’t no rest for the weary.

Less than a week after falling short to Tito Ortiz at Bellator 170, Chael Sonnen will jump back into the fray to square off against decorated Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt Garry Tonon on Jan. 29 in a short-notice grappling match at Submission Underground 3.

Sonnen, the owner and promoter of SUG, serves as a replacement for Tonon’s original opponent, Hector Lombard, who was forced to withdraw from the match due to his upcoming UFC bout against Johny Hendricks on Feb. 19. Sources confirmed the last-second switch to MMA Fighting’s Ariel Helwani on Monday.

SUG 3 takes place on Jan. 29 at the Roseland Theater in Portland, Oregon. The grappling-only event is headlined by a tilt between Conor McGregor training partner Dillon Danis and top BJJ player AJ Agazarm and will stream live on FloGrappling.

This will not be the first time in recent years that Sonnen will try his hand in a grappling-only competition. Last March, Sonnen worked to a three-round draw against UFC middleweight champion Michael Bisping in the combat sports oddity that was the UR Fight pay-per-view.

This time around, Sonnen joins a main card that also features the return of suspended UFC featherweight contender Chad Mendes. An updated SUG 3 main card can be seen below.
